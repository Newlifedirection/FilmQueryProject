## Film Query Application

Retrieval of film details from the database.

### Overview

The command-line Film Query Application is written to retrieve information related
to films stored on the database.

### Features

Upon start-up, the users is welcomed to New Generation Films with a three item menu:
  Look up a film by its id
  Look up a film by a keyword
  Exit the application
Once a selection is made, the appropriate data is retrieved from the Database
and displayed to the screen. The data includes:
Title, movie description, and release year
Language id, rental duration, and rental rate
Movie length, replacement cost, and rating
Special features, language name, and a list of actors.

### Technologies Used

+ MySQL
+ Object-Relational Mapping
+ Data Retrieval with JDBC
+ Mapping Database Data Types
+ Nested Retrieval

### Lessons Learned

Through the process of building this Application, I learned the power and efficiency of
data retrieval combining Java and CRUD (Create, Retrieve, Update, and Destroy) to
interact with MySQL database.
